/**
 * This class only exists to provide an overview document for the package fboace and its sub-packages and classes.
 * <br><br>This package and its sub-packages contain the artifacts for a DEMO generated application, distinct from the 
 * code generation framework. YOUR app will be something else, but with a similar (sub-)package structure: 
 * controller, dao (Repository), model (data entities) and service.
 * <br> All of the sub-packages and their classes here are optional except for those under model; these are the classes 
 * from which all the others are generated. Please note that your application.properties file must include a valid 
 * database connection string and credentials to the schema that your model entities represent; some of the finer-grained
 * attributes needed by RADSpringBootGen are only available from database metadata (views USER_TABLES, USER_TAB_COLUMNS etc).
 * <br> All generated artifacts will eventually be exported to a separate project
 * and application, but during the generation and validation process it may be convenient to integrate them here,
 * effectively conjoining your app under development with the code generation framework during a short period, after which they may all 
 * be exported and deleted from here.
 * <br> Get used to rebuilding and relaunching the RADSpringBootGenApplication several times during your generation and validation process.

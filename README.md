# RADSpringBootGen
Open-source tool from RADical Information Design Corporation
This framework generates Service interfaces, ServiceImpl classes, Web Controller classes and Thymeleaf HTML edit (data maintenance form) files from model entity .java classes.

The framework is in an early and unstable condition but it does work and SAVES HOURS OF MANUAL LABOR under the right conditions. The documentation is a work in progress. 
Therefore if you are interested in using and/or contributing to this, please write to me at hhyde007@icloud.com

# RADSpringBootGen
This framework generates Service interfaces, ServiceImpl classes, Web Controller classes and Thymeleaf HTML edit (data maintenance form) files from model entity .java classes, to create a first-cut end-to-end Java Spring Boot web database application.

The framework is in an early and unstable condition but it does work and SAVES HOURS OF MANUAL LABOR under the right conditions.
